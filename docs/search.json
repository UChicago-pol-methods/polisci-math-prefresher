    "text": "The 2022 UChicago Math Prefresher for incoming Political Science graduate students will be held from September 12-14; September 19-21 and September 23rd. The course is designed as a brief review of math fundamentals – calculus, optimization, probability theory and linear algebra among other topics – as well as an introduction to programming in the R statistical computing language. The course is entirely optional and there are no grades or assignments but we encourage all incoming graduate students to attend if they are able.\n\n\n\nThe course notes for the math and programming sections as well as all practice problems are available on this website and can be accessed by navigating the menus in the sidebar.\n\n\n\nThe prefresher will run for a total of seven days September 12-14, September 19-21 and September 23rd, with breaks for the APSA conference and the new student orientation. Each day will run from around 9am to 4pm with many breaks in between.\nThe morning will focus on math instruction. We will have two one hour sessions from 9:30am - 10:30am and 10:45am-11:45am, with a ~15 minute break in between. These sessions will involve a combination of lectures and working through practice problems.\nWe will break for lunch from 12:00pm-1:00pm. On September 13th and Spetember 19th, we will have a catered lunch with a faculty member guest. Otherwise, you are free to explore the campus for various lunch options.\nThe afternoon will focus on coding instruction with lecture/demonstration from 1:30pm-2:45pm. After a short break you will work together on a variety of coding exercises from 3:00-3:30pm. In the last 30 minutes we will regroup to wrap up and discuss any questions on the material.\n\n\n\nAs the afternoons of the prefresher will involve instruction in coding, you should be sure to bring a laptop and a charging cable. In addition, prior to the start of the prefresher, please make sure to have installed the following on your computer:\n\nR (version 4.2.1 or higher)\nRStudio Desktop Open Source License (this is the primary IDE or integrated development environment in which we will be working)\nLaTeX: This is primarily to allow you to generate PDF documents using RMarkdown. We will use the TinyTeX LaTeX distribution which is designed to be minimalist and tailored specifically for R users. After installing R and RStudio, open up an instance of R, install the ‘tinytex’ package and run the install_tinytex() command\n\n\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n\nWe will also spend some time discussing document preparation and typesetting using LaTeX and Markdown. For the former, we will be using the popular cloud platform Overleaf, which allows for collaborative document editing and streamlines a lot of the irritating parts of typesetting in LaTeX. You should register for an account using your university e-mail as all University of Chicago students and faculty have access to an Overleaf Pro account for free.\nYou are also welcome to install a LaTeX editor on your local machine to work alongside the TinyTeX distribution or any other TeX distribution that you prefer such as TexMaker\n\n\n\nThis prefresher draws heavily on the wonderful materials that have been developed by over 20 years of instructors at the Harvard Government Math Prefresher that have been so generously distributed under the GPL 3.0 License. Special thanks to Shiro Kuriwaki, Yon Soo Park, and Connor Jerzak for their efforts in converting the original prefresher materials into the easily distributed Markdown format."

    "text": "2.2 Introduction to Functions\nA function (in \\({\\mathbf R}^1\\)) is a mapping, or transformation, that relates members of one set to members of another set. For instance, if you have two sets: set \\(A\\) and set \\(B\\), a function from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) maps every value \\(a\\) in set \\(A\\) such that \\(f(a) \\in B\\). Functions can be “many-to-one”, where many values or combinations of values from set \\(A\\) produce a single output in set \\(B\\), or they can be “one-to-one”, where each value in set \\(A\\) corresponds to a single value in set \\(B\\). A function by definition has a single function value for each element of its domain. This means, there cannot be “one-to-many” mapping.\nDimensionality: \\({\\mathbf R}^1\\) is the set of all real numbers extending from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) — i.e., the real number line. \\({\\mathbf R}^n\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional space, where each of the \\(n\\) axes extends from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\).\n\n\\({\\mathbf R}^1\\) is a one dimensional line.\n\\({\\mathbf R}^2\\) is a two dimensional plane.\n\\({\\mathbf R}^3\\) is a three dimensional space.\n\nPoints in \\({\\mathbf R}^n\\) are ordered \\(n\\)-tuples (just means an combination of \\(n\\) elements where order matters), where each element of the \\(n\\)-tuple represents the coordinate along that dimension.\nFor example:\n\n\\({\\mathbf R}^1\\): (3)\n\\({\\mathbf R}^2\\): (-15, 5)\n\\({\\mathbf R}^3\\): (86, 4, 0)\n\nExamples of mapping notation:\nFunction of one variable: \\(f:{\\mathbf R}^1\\to{\\mathbf R}^1\\)\n\n\\(f(x)=x+1\\).

For each ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) in \\({\\mathbf R}^2\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) assigns the number \\(x^2+y^2\\).\n\nWe often use variable \\(x\\) as input and another \\(y\\) as output, e.g. \\(y=x+1\\)\n```{example, name = “Functions”, functions}\nFor each of the following, state whether they are one-to-one or many-to-one functions.\n\nFor \\(x \\in [0,\\infty]\\), \\(f : x \\rightarrow x^2\\) (this could also be written as \\(f(x) = x^2\\)).\nFor \\(x \\in [-\\infty, \\infty]\\), \\(f: x \\rightarrow x^2\\).\n\n\n```{exercise, name = \"Functions\", functions1}\n\nFor each of the following, state whether they are one-to-one or many-to-one functions. \n\n\n1.

We can also write the sequence as [{x_n}^_{n=1}]\nwhere the subscript and superscript are read together as “from 1 to infinity.”\n\n\nHow do these sequences behave?\n  \n1. $\\{A_n\\}=\\left\\{ 2-\\frac{1}{n^2} \\right\\}$\n2. $\\{B_n\\}=\\left\\{\\frac{n^2+1}{n} \\right\\}$\n3. $\\{C_n\\}=\\left\\{(-1)^n \\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\right\\}$\n  \n  \n\nWe find the sequence by simply “plugging in” the integers into each \\(n\\). The important thing is to get a sense of how these numbers are going to change. Example 1’s numbers seem to come closer and closer to 2, but will it ever surpass 2? Example 2’s numbers are also increasing each time, but will it hit a limit? What is the pattern in Example 3? Graphing helps you make this point more clearly. See the sequence of \\(n = 1, ...20\\) for each of the three examples in Figure @ref(fig:seqabc).\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavior of Some Sequences"

    "text": "3.2 The Limit of a Sequence\nThe notion of “converging to a limit” is the behavior of the points in Example @ref(exm:seqbehav). In some sense, that’s the counterfactual we want to know. What happens as \\(n\\rightarrow \\infty\\)?\n\nSequences like 1 above that converge to a limit.\nSequences like 2 above that increase without bound.\nSequences like 3 above that neither converge nor increase without bound — alternating over the number line.\n\n\nThe sequence $\\{y_n\\}$ has the limit $L$, which we write as \\[\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n =L\\], if for any $\\epsilon>0$ there is an integer $N$ (which depends on $\\epsilon$) with the property that $|y_n -L|<\\epsilon$ for each $n>N$.  $\\{y_n\\}$ is said to converge to $L$.  If the above does not hold, then $\\{y_n\\}$ diverges.\n\nWe can also express the behavior of a sequence as bounded or not:\n\nBounded: if \\(|y_n|\\le K\\) for all \\(n\\)\nMonotonically Increasing: \\(y_{n+1}>y_n\\) for all \\(n\\)\nMonotonically Decreasing: \\(y_{n+1}<y_n\\) for all \\(n\\)\n\nA limit is unique: If \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) converges, then the limit \\(L\\) is unique.\nIf a sequence converges, then the sum of such sequences also converges. Let \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n = y\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} z_n =z\\). Then\n\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} [k y_n + \\ell z_n]= k y + \\ell z\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n z_n = yz\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{y_n}{z_n} = \\frac{y}{z}\\), provided \\(z\\neq 0\\)\n\nThis looks reasonable enough. The harder question, obviously is when the parts of the fraction don’t converge. If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n = \\infty\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} z_n = \\infty\\), What is \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n - z_n\\)? What is \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{y_n}{z_n}\\)?\nIt is nice for a sequence to converge in limit. We want to know if complex-looking sequences converge or not. The name of the game here is to break that complex sequence up into sums of simple fractions where \\(n\\) only appears in the denominator: \\(\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n^2}\\), and so on. Each of these will converge to 0, because the denominator gets larger and larger. Then, because of the properties above, we can then find the final sequence.\n\nFind the limit of \n\\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{n + 3}{n},\\]\n\n\nAt first glance, $n + 3$ and $n$  both grow to $\\infty$, so it looks like we need to divide infinity by infinity. However, we can express this fraction as a sum, then the limits apply separately:\n  \n\\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{n + 3}{n} = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{n}\\right) =  \\underbrace{\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}1}_{1} +  \\underbrace{\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\left(\\frac{3}{n}\\right)}_{0}\\]\n\nso, the limit is actually 1. \n\nAfter some practice, the key to intuition is whether one part of the fraction grows “faster” than another. If the denominator grows faster to infinity than the numerator, then the fraction will converge to 0, even if the numerator will also increase to infinity. In a sense, limits show how not all infinities are the same.\n\nFind the following limits of sequences, then explain in English the intuition for why that is the case. \n\n 1.  \\(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{2n}{n^2 + 1}\\)\n 2.  \\(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} (n^3 - 100n^2)\\)"

    "text": "3.3 Limits of a Function\nWe’ve now covered functions and just covered limits of sequences, so now is the time to combine the two.\nA function \\(f\\) is a compact representation of some behavior we care about. Like for sequences, we often want to know if \\(f(x)\\) approaches some number \\(L\\) as its independent variable \\(x\\) moves to some number \\(c\\) (which is usually 0 or \\(\\pm\\infty\\)). If it does, we say that the limit of \\(f(x)\\), as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\), is \\(L\\): \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)=L\\). Unlike a sequence, \\(x\\) is a continuous number, and we can move in decreasing order as well as increasing.\nFor a limit \\(L\\) to exist, the function \\(f(x)\\) must approach \\(L\\) from both the left (increasing) and the right (decreasing).\n\nLet $f(x)$ be defined at each point in some open interval containing the point $c$.  Then $L$ equals $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)$ if for any (small positive) number $\\epsilon$, there exists a corresponding number $\\delta>0$ such that if $0<|x-c|<\\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon$.\n\nA neat, if subtle result is that \\(f(x)\\) does not necessarily have to be defined at \\(c\\) for \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c}\\) to exist.\nProperties: Let \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) be functions with \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)=k\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)=\\ell\\).\n\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c}[f(x)+g(x)]=\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)+ \\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} kf(x) = k\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x) g(x) = \\left[\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)\\right]\\cdot \\left[\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)\\right]\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)}{\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)}\\), provided \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)\\ne 0\\).\n\nSimple limits of functions can be solved as we did limits of sequences.

First, the functions may become large polynomials with many moving pieces. Second,the functions may become discontinuous.\nThe function can be thought of as a more general or “smooth” version of sequences. For example,\n\n\nFind the limit of\n\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{(x^4 +3x−99)(2−x^5)}{(18x^7 +9x^6 −3x^2 −1)(x+1)}\\]\n\nNow, the functions will become a bit more complex:\n\nSolve the following limits of functions\n\n1. $\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0} |x|$\n2. $\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0} \\left(1+\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)$\n\n\nSo there are a few more alternatives about what a limit of a function could be:\n\nRight-hand limit: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) when you move from right to left.\nLeft-hand limit: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) when you move from left to right.\nInfinity: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) as x grows infinitely large. Sometimes this may be a number; sometimes it might be \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\).\nNegative infinity: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) as x grows infinitely negative. Sometimes this may be a number; sometimes it might be \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\).\n\nThe distinction between left and right becomes important when the function is not determined for some values of \\(x\\).

    "text": "3.4 Continuity\nTo repeat a finding from the limits of functions: \\(f(x)\\) does not necessarily have to be defined at \\(c\\) for \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c}\\) to exist. Functions that have breaks in their lines are called discontinuous. Functions that have no breaks are called continuous. Continuity is a concept that is more fundamental to, but related to that of “differentiability”, which we will cover next in calculus.\n\nSuppose that the domain of the function $f$ includes an open interval containing the point $c$.  Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)$ exists and if $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)=f(c)$. Further, $f$ is continuous on an open interval $(a,b)$ if it is continuous at each point in the interval.\n\nTo prove that a function is continuous for all points is beyond this practical introduction to math, but the general intuition can be grasped by graphing.\n\n\nFor each function, determine if it is continuous or discontinuous. \n\n 1. $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$\n 2. $f(x) = e^x$\n 3. $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$ \n 4. $f(x) = \\text{floor}(x)$. \n \n \nThe floor is the smaller of the two integers bounding a number.
