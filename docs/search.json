    "text": "The 2022 UChicago Math Prefresher for incoming Political Science graduate students will be held from September 12-14; September 19-21 and September 23rd. The course is designed as a brief review of math fundamentals – calculus, optimization, probability theory and linear algebra among other topics – as well as an introduction to programming in the R statistical computing language. The course is entirely optional and there are no grades or assignments but we encourage all incoming graduate students to attend if they are able.\n\n\n\nThe course notes for the math and programming sections as well as all practice problems are available on this website and can be accessed by navigating the menus in the sidebar.\n\n\n\nThe prefresher will run for a total of seven days September 12-14, September 19-21 and September 23rd, with breaks for the APSA conference and the new student orientation. Each day will run from around 9am to 4pm with many breaks in between.\nThe morning will focus on math instruction. We will have two one hour sessions from 9:30am - 10:30am and 10:45am-11:45am, with a ~15 minute break in between. These sessions will involve a combination of lectures and working through practice problems.\nWe will break for lunch from 12:00pm-1:00pm. On September 13th and Spetember 19th, we will have a catered lunch with a faculty member guest. Otherwise, you are free to explore the campus for various lunch options.\nThe afternoon will focus on coding instruction with lecture/demonstration from 1:30pm-2:45pm. After a short break you will work together on a variety of coding exercises from 3:00-3:30pm. In the last 30 minutes we will regroup to wrap up and discuss any questions on the material.\n\n\n\nAs the afternoons of the prefresher will involve instruction in coding, you should be sure to bring a laptop and a charging cable. In addition, prior to the start of the prefresher, please make sure to have installed the following on your computer:\n\nR (version 4.2.1 or higher)\nRStudio Desktop Open Source License (this is the primary IDE or integrated development environment in which we will be working)\nLaTeX: This is primarily to allow you to generate PDF documents using RMarkdown. We will use the TinyTeX LaTeX distribution which is designed to be minimalist and tailored specifically for R users. After installing R and RStudio, open up an instance of R, install the ‘tinytex’ package and run the install_tinytex() command\n\n\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n\nWe will also spend some time discussing document preparation and typesetting using LaTeX and Markdown. For the former, we will be using the popular cloud platform Overleaf, which allows for collaborative document editing and streamlines a lot of the irritating parts of typesetting in LaTeX. You should register for an account using your university e-mail as all University of Chicago students and faculty have access to an Overleaf Pro account for free.\nYou are also welcome to install a LaTeX editor on your local machine to work alongside the TinyTeX distribution or any other TeX distribution that you prefer such as TexMaker\n\n\n\nThis prefresher draws heavily on the wonderful materials that have been developed by over 20 years of instructors at the Harvard Government Math Prefresher that have been so generously distributed under the GPL 3.0 License. Special thanks to Shiro Kuriwaki, Yon Soo Park, and Connor Jerzak for their efforts in converting the original prefresher materials into the easily distributed Markdown format."

In statistics and calculus, we want to add a sequence of numbers that can be expressed as a pattern without needing to write down all its components. For example, how would we express the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 without writing a hundred numbers?\nFor this we use the summation operator \\(\\sum\\) and the product operator \\(\\prod\\).\nSummation:\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{100} x_i = x_1+x_2+x_3+\\cdots+x_{100}\\)\nThe bottom of the \\(\\sum\\) symbol indicates an index (here, \\(i\\)), and its start value \\(1\\). At the top is where the index ends. The notion of “addition” is part of the \\(\\sum\\) symbol. The content to the right of the summation is the meat of what we add.

    "text": "2.2 Introduction to Functions\nA function (in \\({\\mathbf R}^1\\)) is a mapping, or transformation, that relates members of one set to members of another set. For instance, if you have two sets: set \\(A\\) and set \\(B\\), a function from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) maps every value \\(a\\) in set \\(A\\) such that \\(f(a) \\in B\\). Functions can be “many-to-one”, where many values or combinations of values from set \\(A\\) produce a single output in set \\(B\\), or they can be “one-to-one”, where each value in set \\(A\\) corresponds to a single value in set \\(B\\). A function by definition has a single function value for each element of its domain. This means, there cannot be “one-to-many” mapping.\nDimensionality: \\({\\mathbf R}^1\\) is the set of all real numbers extending from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) — i.e., the real number line. \\({\\mathbf R}^n\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional space, where each of the \\(n\\) axes extends from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\).\n\n\\({\\mathbf R}^1\\) is a one dimensional line.\n\\({\\mathbf R}^2\\) is a two dimensional plane.\n\\({\\mathbf R}^3\\) is a three dimensional space.\n\nPoints in \\({\\mathbf R}^n\\) are ordered \\(n\\)-tuples (just means an combination of \\(n\\) elements where order matters), where each element of the \\(n\\)-tuple represents the coordinate along that dimension.\nFor example:\n\n\\({\\mathbf R}^1\\): (3)\n\\({\\mathbf R}^2\\): (-15, 5)\n\\({\\mathbf R}^3\\): (86, 4, 0)\n\nExamples of mapping notation:\nFunction of one variable: \\(f:{\\mathbf R}^1\\to{\\mathbf R}^1\\)\n\n\\(f(x)=x+1\\).

For each ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) in \\({\\mathbf R}^2\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) assigns the number \\(x^2+y^2\\).\n\nWe often use variable \\(x\\) as input and another \\(y\\) as output, e.g. \\(y=x+1\\)\n```{example, name = “Functions”, functions}\nFor each of the following, state whether they are one-to-one or many-to-one functions.\n\nFor \\(x \\in [0,\\infty]\\), \\(f : x \\rightarrow x^2\\) (this could also be written as \\(f(x) = x^2\\)).\nFor \\(x \\in [-\\infty, \\infty]\\), \\(f: x \\rightarrow x^2\\).\n\n\n```{exercise, name = \"Functions\", functions1}\n\nFor each of the following, state whether they are one-to-one or many-to-one functions. \n\n\n1. For $x \\in [-3, \\infty]$, $f: x \\rightarrow x^2$.\n\n\n2. For $x \\in [0, \\infty]$, $f: x \\rightarrow \\sqrt{x}$\n  \n\n\nSome functions are defined only on proper subsets of \\({\\mathbf R}^n\\).\n\nDomain: the set of numbers in \\(X\\) at which \\(f(x)\\) is defined.\nRange: elements of \\(Y\\) assigned by \\(f(x)\\) to elements of \\(X\\), or \\[f(X)=\\{ y : y=f(x), x\\in X\\}\\] Most often used when talking about a function \\(f:{\\mathbf R}^1\\to{\\mathbf R}^1\\).\nImage: same as range, but more often used when talking about a function \\(f:{\\mathbf R}^n\\to{\\mathbf R}^1\\).\n\nSome General Types of Functions\nMonomials: \\(f(x)=a x^k\\)\n\\(a\\) is the coefficient. \\(k\\) is the degree.\nExamples: \\(y=x^2\\), \\(y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^3\\)\nPolynomials: sum of monomials.\nExamples: \\(y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^3+x^2\\), \\(y=3x+5\\)\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of its monomial terms.
