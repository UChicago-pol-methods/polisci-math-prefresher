    "text": "The 2022 UChicago Math Prefresher for incoming Political Science graduate students will be held from September 12-14; September 19-21 and September 23rd. The course is designed as a brief review of math fundamentals – calculus, optimization, probability theory and linear algebra among other topics – as well as an introduction to programming in the R statistical computing language. The course is entirely optional and there are no grades or assignments but we encourage all incoming graduate students to attend if they are able.\n\n\n\nThe course notes for the math and programming sections as well as all practice problems are available on this website and can be accessed by navigating the menus in the sidebar.\n\n\n\nThe prefresher will run for a total of seven days September 12-14, September 19-21 and September 23rd, with breaks for the APSA conference and the new student orientation. Each day will run from around 9am to 4pm with many breaks in between.\nThe morning will focus on math instruction. We will have two one hour sessions from 9:30am - 10:30am and 10:45am-11:45am, with a ~15 minute break in between. These sessions will involve a combination of lectures and working through practice problems.\nWe will break for lunch from 12:00pm-1:00pm. On September 13th and Spetember 19th, we will have a catered lunch with a faculty member guest. Otherwise, you are free to explore the campus for various lunch options.\nThe afternoon will focus on coding instruction with lecture/demonstration from 1:30pm-2:45pm. After a short break you will work together on a variety of coding exercises from 3:00-3:30pm. In the last 30 minutes we will regroup to wrap up and discuss any questions on the material.\n\n\n\nAs the afternoons of the prefresher will involve instruction in coding, you should be sure to bring a laptop and a charging cable. In addition, prior to the start of the prefresher, please make sure to have installed the following on your computer:\n\nR (version 4.2.1 or higher)\nRStudio Desktop Open Source License (this is the primary IDE or integrated development environment in which we will be working)\nLaTeX: This is primarily to allow you to generate PDF documents using RMarkdown. We will use the TinyTeX LaTeX distribution which is designed to be minimalist and tailored specifically for R users. After installing R and RStudio, open up an instance of R, install the ‘tinytex’ package and run the install_tinytex() command\n\n\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n\nWe will also spend some time discussing document preparation and typesetting using LaTeX and Markdown. For the former, we will be using the popular cloud platform Overleaf, which allows for collaborative document editing and streamlines a lot of the irritating parts of typesetting in LaTeX. You should register for an account using your university e-mail as all University of Chicago students and faculty have access to an Overleaf Pro account for free.\nYou are also welcome to install a LaTeX editor on your local machine to work alongside the TinyTeX distribution or any other TeX distribution that you prefer such as TexMaker\n\n\n\nThis prefresher draws heavily on the wonderful materials that have been developed by over 20 years of instructors at the Harvard Government Math Prefresher that have been so generously distributed under the GPL 3.0 License. Special thanks to Shiro Kuriwaki, Yon Soo Park, and Connor Jerzak for their efforts in converting the original prefresher materials into the easily distributed Markdown format."

    "text": "Sets are the fundamental building blocks of mathematics. Events are not inherently numerical: the onset of war or the stock market crashing is not inherently a number. Sets can define such events, and we wrap math around so that we have a transparent language to communicate about those events. Combining sets with operations, relations, metrics, measures, etc… allows us to define useful mathematical structures. For example, the set of real numbers (\\(\\mathbb{R}\\)) has a notion of order as well as defined operations of addition and multiplication.\nSet : A set is any well defined collection of elements. If \\(x\\) is an element of \\(S\\), \\(x \\in S\\).\nExamples:\n\nThe set of choices available to a player in Rock-Paper-Scissors \\(\\{\\text{Rock}, \\text{Paper}, \\text{Scissors}\\}\\)\nThe set of possible outcomes of a roll of a six-sided die \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\)\nThe set of all natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\)\nThe set of all real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)\n\nCommon mathematical notation relevant to sets:\n\n\\(\\in\\) = “is an element of”; \\(\\notin\\) = “is not an element of”\n\\(\\forall\\) = “for all” (univeral quantifier)\n\\(\\exists\\) = “there exists” (existential quantifier)\n\\(:\\) = “such that”\n\nSubset: If every element of set \\(A\\) is also in set \\(B\\), then \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\). \\(A \\subseteq B\\). If, in addition to being a subset of \\(B\\), \\(A\\) is not equal to \\(B\\), \\(A\\) is a proper subset \\(A \\subset B\\).\nEmpty Set: a set with no elements. \\(S = \\{\\}\\). It is denoted by the symbol \\(\\emptyset\\).\nCardinality: The cardinality of a set \\(S\\), typically written \\(|S|\\) is the number of members of \\(S\\).\nMany sets are infinite. For example, \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) the set of natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \\dotsc\\}\\) - Sets with cardinality less than \\(|\\mathbb{N}|\\) are countable - Sets with the same cardinality as \\(\\\\mathbb{N}|\\) are countably infinite - Sets with greater cardinality than \\(|\\mathbb{N}|\\) are uncountably infinite (e.g. the real numbers).\nSet operations:\n\nUnion: The union of two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(A \\cup B\\), is the set containing all of the elements in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). \\(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_n = \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\)\nIntersection: The intersection of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(A \\cap B\\), is the set containing all of the elements in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). \\(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n = \\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\\)\nComplement: If set \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(S\\), then the complement of \\(A\\), denoted \\(A^C\\), is the set containing all of the elements in \\(S\\) that are not in \\(A\\).\n\nProperties of set operations:\n\nCommutative: \\(A \\cup B = B \\cup A\\); \\(A \\cap B = B \\cap A\\)\nAssociative: \\(A \\cup (B \\cup C) = (A \\cup B) \\cup C\\); \\(A \\cap (B \\cap C) = (A \\cap B) \\cap C\\)\nDistributive: \\(A \\cap (B \\cup C) = (A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C)\\); \\(A \\cup (B \\cap C) = (A \\cup B) \\cap (A \\cup C)\\)\nde Morgan’s laws: \\((A \\cup B)^C = A^C \\cap B^C\\); \\((A \\cap B)^C = A^C \\cup B^C\\)\nDisjointness: Sets are disjoint when they do not intersect, such that \\(A \\cap B = \\emptyset\\). A collection of sets is pairwise disjoint (mutually exclusive) if, for all \\(i \\neq j\\), \\(A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset\\). A collection of sets form a partition of set \\(S\\) if they are pairwise disjoint and they cover set \\(S\\), such that \\(\\bigcup_{i = 1}^k A_i = S\\).\n\n\nExample 2.1 (Sets) Let set \\(A\\) be \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\), \\(B\\) be \\(\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), and \\(C\\) be \\(\\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}\\). Sets \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are all subsets of the \\(S\\) which is \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}\\)\nWrite out the following sets:\n\n\\(A \\cup B\\)\n\\(C \\cap B\\)\n\\(B^c\\)\n\\(A \\cap (B \\cup C)\\)\n\n\n\nExercise 2.1 (Sets) Suppose you had a pair of four-sided dice. You sum the results from a single toss.\nWhat is the set of possible outcomes?\nConsider subsets \\(A=\\{2, 8\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{2,3,7\\}\\) of the sample space you found.

The interior of \\(S\\) is the collection of all interior points in \\(S\\). The interior can also be defined as the union of all open sets in \\(S\\).\n\nIf the set \\(S\\) is circular, the interior points are everything inside of the circle, but not on the circle’s rim.\nExample: The interior of the set \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2\\le 4 \\}\\) is \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2< 4 \\}\\) .\n\nBoundary Point: The point \\(\\mathbf x\\) is a boundary point of the set \\(S\\) if every \\(\\epsilon\\)-ball around \\(\\mathbf x\\) contains both points that are in \\(S\\) and points that are outside \\(S\\). The boundary is the collection of all boundary points.\n\nIf the set \\(S\\) is circular, the boundary points are everything on the circle’s rim.\nExample: The boundary of \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2\\le 4 \\}\\) is \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2 = 4 \\}\\).\n\nOpen: A set \\(S\\) is open if for each point \\(\\mathbf x\\) in \\(S\\), there exists an open \\(\\epsilon\\)-ball around \\(\\mathbf x\\) completely contained in \\(S\\).\n\nIf the set \\(S\\) is circular and open, the points contained within the set get infinitely close to the circle’s rim, but do not touch it.\nExample: \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2<4 \\}\\)\n\nClosed: A set \\(S\\) is closed if it contains all of its boundary points.\n\nAlternatively: A set is closed if its complement is open.\nIf the set \\(S\\) is circular and closed, the set contains all points within the rim as well as the rim itself.\nExample: \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2\\le 4 \\}\\)\nNote: a set may be neither open nor closed.

For instance, if you have two sets: set \\(A\\) and set \\(B\\), a function from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) maps every value \\(a\\) in set \\(A\\) such that \\(f(a) \\in B\\). Functions can be “many-to-one”, where many values or combinations of values from set \\(A\\) produce a single output in set \\(B\\), or they can be “one-to-one”, where each value in set \\(A\\) corresponds to a single value in set \\(B\\). A function by definition has a single function value for each element of its domain. This means, there cannot be “one-to-many” mapping.\nDimensionality: \\({\\mathbf R}^1\\) is the set of all real numbers extending from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) — i.e., the real number line. \\({\\mathbf R}^n\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional space, where each of the \\(n\\) axes extends from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\).\n\n\\({\\mathbf R}^1\\) is a one dimensional line.\n\\({\\mathbf R}^2\\) is a two dimensional plane.\n\\({\\mathbf R}^3\\) is a three dimensional space.\n\nPoints in \\({\\mathbf R}^n\\) are ordered \\(n\\)-tuples (just means an combination of \\(n\\) elements where order matters), where each element of the \\(n\\)-tuple represents the coordinate along that dimension.\nFor example:\n\n\\({\\mathbf R}^1\\): (3)\n\\({\\mathbf R}^2\\): (-15, 5)\n\\({\\mathbf R}^3\\): (86, 4, 0)\n\nExamples of mapping notation:\nFunction of one variable: \\(f:{\\mathbf R}^1\\to{\\mathbf R}^1\\)\n\n\\(f(x)=x+1\\).

The second is for the study of statistical inference, which is the study of inferring things about things you cannot see by using things you can see."

    "text": "3.2 The Limit of a Sequence\nThe notion of “converging to a limit” is the behavior of the points in Example -@#exm-seqbehav. In some sense, that’s the counterfactual we want to know. What happens as \\(n\\rightarrow \\infty\\)?\n\nSequences like 1 above that converge to a limit.\nSequences like 2 above that increase without bound.\nSequences like 3 above that neither converge nor increase without bound — alternating over the number line.\n\nDefinition: Limit The sequence \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) has the limit \\(L\\), which we write as \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n =L\\), if for any \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is an integer \\(N\\) (which depends on \\(\\epsilon\\)) with the property that \\(|y_n -L|<\\epsilon\\) for each \\(n>N\\). \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) is said to converge to \\(L\\). If the above does not hold, then \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) diverges.\nWe can also express the behavior of a sequence as bounded or not:\n\nBounded: if \\(|y_n|\\le K\\) for all \\(n\\)\nMonotonically Increasing: \\(y_{n+1}>y_n\\) for all \\(n\\)\nMonotonically Decreasing: \\(y_{n+1}<y_n\\) for all \\(n\\)\n\nA limit is unique: If \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) converges, then the limit \\(L\\) is unique.\nIf a sequence converges, then the sum of such sequences also converges. Let \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n = y\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} z_n =z\\). Then\n\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} [k y_n + \\ell z_n]= k y + \\ell z\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n z_n = yz\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{y_n}{z_n} = \\frac{y}{z}\\), provided \\(z\\neq 0\\)\n\nThis looks reasonable enough. The harder question, obviously is when the parts of the fraction don’t converge. If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n = \\infty\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} z_n = \\infty\\), What is \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n - z_n\\)? What is \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{y_n}{z_n}\\)?\nIt is nice for a sequence to converge in limit. We want to know if complex-looking sequences converge or not. The name of the game here is to break that complex sequence up into sums of simple fractions where \\(n\\) only appears in the denominator: \\(\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n^2}\\), and so on. Each of these will converge to 0, because the denominator gets larger and larger. Then, because of the properties above, we can then find the final sequence.\n\nExample 3.2 (Ratios) Find the limit of \\(\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{n + 3}{n}\\)\n\n\nSolution. At first glance, \\(n + 3\\) and \\(n\\) both grow to \\(\\infty\\), so it looks like we need to divide infinity by infinity. However, we can express this fraction as a sum, then the limits apply separately:\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{n + 3}{n} = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{n}\\right) =  \\underbrace{\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}1}_{1} +  \\underbrace{\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\left(\\frac{3}{n}\\right)}_{0}\\]\nso, the limit is actually 1.\n\nAfter some practice, the key to intuition is whether one part of the fraction grows “faster” than another. If the denominator grows faster to infinity than the numerator, then the fraction will converge to 0, even if the numerator will also increase to infinity. In a sense, limits show how not all infinities are the same.\n\nExercise 3.1 (Limits) Find the following limits of sequences, then explain in English the intuition for why that is the case.\n\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{2n}{n^2 + 1}\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} (n^3 - 100n^2)\\)"

Functions that have breaks in their lines are called discontinuous. Functions that have no breaks are called continuous. Continuity is a concept that is more fundamental to, but related to that of “differentiability”, which we will cover next in calculus.\n\nDefinition 3.2 (Continuity) Suppose that the domain of the function \\(f\\) includes an open interval containing the point \\(c\\).
